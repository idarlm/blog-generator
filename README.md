# Haskell Blog Generator

This project follows the book [Learn Haskell by building a blog generator](https://learn-haskell.blog/01-about.html). This project is meant as a learning supplement for a university course that teaches Haskell.

# Required software

There are two ways to get this project up and running:

**Method 1: Dev container ☀️😎 (requires docker, cool)**

This project includes the necessary `devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` needed to build a fully functional dev container. This requires Docker or another Docker compatible container runtime to be installed.

**Method 2: Install Haskell 😪💤 (lame, not cool)**

Install Haskell manually by following the instructions [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). This project uses Stack, so make sure that is installed. HLS is also a good idea.
